# 👋 Hi, I’m Pablo Wills  

I am a Data Analyst driven by the simple idea that better decisions come from clearer insights.  
My work blends **machine learning**, **predictive modeling**, and **analytical storytelling** to uncover patterns, challenge assumptions, and solve real operational challenges.

I’m not here to just build models
I’m here to build understanding.

## ⭐ What I Bring to the Table  
With a strong foundation in analytics and an instinct for practical problem-solving, I focus on creating solutions that are:

- **Accurate** — grounded in solid statistical reasoning  
- **Interpretable** — models and visuals anyone can understand  
- **Relevant** — aligned with real business needs and outcomes  
- **Reusable** — clean, organized, and reproducible work  

My approach is shaped by a belief learned early:  
**Data is only valuable when someone can act on it.**

## 🔧 Technical Toolkit  
I work with the tools that turn raw information into clarity:

**Python • Pandas • NumPy • Scikit-Learn • SQL • Power BI • Matplotlib • Seaborn  
Predictive Modeling • EDA • Feature Engineering • Statistical Analysis**

But more importantly: I know how to choose the right tool for the problem.

## 📘 Projects That Reflect My Thinking  
Every project in this portfolio was built with intention — not just to model data, but to understand it, challenge it, and communicate it.

- **Medical Appointment No-Show Prediction**  
  *Predictive modeling to reduce operational friction and improve patient flow.*

- **U.S. Rent Price Prediction Model**  
  *Economic, geographic, and behavioral factors translated into actionable pricing insights.*

- **Brand Positioning Analysis**  
  *Using data to reveal perception gaps and strategic opportunities.*

More projects are added as I explore new questions and refine my craft.

## 🧠 How I Approach Analytics  
Great analytics is more than code; it’s a mindset.

- **Curiosity** — Why does this happen? What drives this behavior?  
- **Structure** — Break the complex into steps that make sense.  
- **Communication** — Insights must be understood to matter.  
- **Impact** — Data should make someone’s work easier, smarter, or faster.

I aim to operate where logic meets creativity — where patterns become narratives.

## 🚀 Currently Exploring  
To stay ahead in a field that never stands still, I’m deepening my knowledge in:

- Model interpretability and real-time deployment  
- Forecasting models for dynamic environments  
- Advanced visualization techniques for clearer storytelling
